on the core technologies we have cultivated since our founding.
Here, we introduce these core technologies. - Adhesion is the origin of Nitto. With the function of “attaching” and “peeling”, we contribute to various applications in many fields such as construction and automobile where high durability is required to withstand long-term use in the outdoors, electronics where accuracy is required, and the medical field where the property of softness to the skin is required.; Optical design is a technology used to handle reflection, scattering, refraction of light, or transmit only a specific wavelength of light at will using special films. Optical design is used in various applications such as TV, PC, smartphone, and display for automobile which requires high durability.; Thin layer formation technology is used to form a thin layer with various functions on a film. Nitto is especially good at Roll-to-roll processing, which forms a thin layer during the process of unwinding and rewinding of a film. We have a wide variety of technologies such as precise coating of organic substances with submicron thickness, and sputtering or vapor deposition which forms a layer with inorganic substances at nano level.; Circuit formation is a technology of combining conductive materials with insulation materials to create a fine electric circuit. Nitto is especially good at forming a precise circuit on the metal substrate. We also have the technology of significantly accelerating the speed of signal transmission by means of combining an electric circuit with an optical circuit.; Sepreration this technology is used to separate and take out a certain substance from a mixture. With the technology, we can produce fresh water from sea water, or take valuables out from waste liquid. In recent years, we have worked on the separation of gases, carbon dioxide for instance, so that we can contribute to the conservation of the global environment.; Porous formation is a technology used to design and form void structure to achieve required functions. In addition to the function of softening vibration, sound, or physical impact, we can change electric properties and control adsorption properties.; Oligonucleotide synthesis this technology is used to synthesize oligonucleotide consisting of four compounds in a predetermined sequence. Properly designed oligonucleotide works as a pharmaceutical drug directly acting on genes of cancer cells or viruses. In addition to synthesizing oligonucleotide in a predetermined sequence, Nitto itself can design a sequence to create a new pharmaceutical drug.; DDS：Drug Delivery System. DDS is a technology used to properly control a dosage, or to deliver drugs only to target organs, cells, or genes. The purpose is to increase the effectiveness of drugs, reduce side effects, etc.",-,Manufacturer & Development.,Hydrogen Production Equipment Manaufacturers and its apparatus,https://www.nitto.com/sea/en/,Website; Tel: +32-89-36-09-99; E: bart.peeters@nitto.com,-,-,N,NITTO EMEA_Logo_Image_839.png,NITTO EMEA_Rep_Image_840.png,NITTO EMEA_NewsProj_Image_841.png,,NITTO EMEA_Highlight_Image_842.png
